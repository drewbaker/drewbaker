## Bio

> A team focused software engineer and leader who enjoys tackling complex problems that demand a system architect’s mindset and a scalable, long-term approach. My preferred stack is JavaScript, with deep experience in Node, Vue, Nuxt, and Nitro. I consider myself AI-native, integrating AI into my daily workflow to design, build, and optimize faster.

I enjoy challenges that require not just coding, but building elegant, scalable systems that connect product, design, and engineering. Whether architecting APIs, shaping front-end frameworks, or mapping out long-term technical strategy, I prefer environments where thoughtful design and technical rigor come together to create something both powerful and beautiful.

### How I simplified a complex local state using VuexORM

This is a presentation I gave to the VueJS LA meetup group on September 8th, 2020

> I have an application that deals with data that is highly nested (or relational). Storing this in a traditional way and having it remain accessible is a real problem. That’s where Object-Relational Mapping tools can help. I’ll show you how I used VuexORM to greatly simplify my Vuex store.

### How to leverage 8Base to rapidly build a Nuxt/Vue web application, without needing to know anything about servers!

This is a presentation I gave to the VueJS LA meetup group on June 9th, 2020

> This will be a live coding session, where Drew shows us how to rapidly develop a Vue/Nuxt App, with a GraphQL API backend, including JWT Auth, and an updating database. Drew is an extremely experienced developer, so we'll get to see him in action as he build a very cool app right in front of out eyes.
> 
> For those of you who are unfamiliar, 8Base is a GraphQL backend as a service. You can think of it as a more robust version of Firebase, where you get an *entire database backend* available to you via a GUI (create tables, relationships, datatypes etc. all through a GUI). Moreso, the 8Base API is served to the frontend as a GraphQL API.  Should be interesting to see Drew quickly prototype a Nuxt/GraphQL (8Base) App, with Auth and everything else included.

### Using GraphQL with Nuxt and Apollo
Myself and an employee at Funkhaus presented this to the VueJS LA meetup on May 14th, 2019.

> By popular demand, Drew Baker will presenting on using Graph QL within the Vue.js ecosystem. For those who don't know what Graph QL is, it is a "web API query language" allowing developer an alternative to writing REST APIs. If that sounds strange, it is at first, until you see it. To "get" Graph QL, you'll have to come check it out to see what Graph QL is and how it is implemented. Drew will start by giving a little overview of what Graph QL is, how it differs from REST, how it can be useful to web-development, and specifically how to use it in the context of a Vue.js application.
